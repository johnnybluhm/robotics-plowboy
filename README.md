Final project for robotics. This is an epuck that acts as a snowplow.

# Running instructions
- Open less_snow.wbt or more_snow.wbt in webots
- Press play
- You should see a robot plow the snow away
- Two worlds were provided to show robot can handle differing amounts of snow
- Don't have webots? https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/installation-procedure

# Other info
- Other world files are failed implementations
- plow.py is the vehicle controller we started on
- video demonstration: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_3nsMpT2Sw
